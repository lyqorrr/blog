# 🌩️ Lyqorrr - Cloud Security Architect Portfolio

## ✨ Overview

This is my personal portfolio website where I document my learning path in cybersecurity, cloud security, and systems programming. The site features a warm, organic aesthetic with moody neutrals and amber accents, smooth animations, and a focus on both elegance and readability.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Portfolio**: Showcase my skills, projects, and learning focus areas
- **Daily Logs**: Document my learning progress and insights
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Share technical experiences and travel reflections
- **Professional Presence**: Establish a digital identity in the cybersecurity space

## 🚀 Features

### Design & UX
- **Warm Organic Theme**: Eye-friendly dark background with sophisticated amber (#d9a05b) and copper accents
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-ins, slide-downs, and gentle hover effects

## 🎨 Color Palette - Moody Neutrals with Amber

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Graphite | `#34312d` | Primary Background |
| Warm Black | `#2b2724` | Card backgrounds, darker sections |
| Amber | `#d9a05b` | Primary accent, links, CTAs |
| Copper | `#b87d4b` | Secondary accent, hover states |
| Warm Gray | `#a3978c` | Body text, secondary text |
| Ivory | `#f7f0e8` | Headings, primary text |
| Rust | `#9d5c3f` | Subtle highlights |

### Design Philosophy
The color scheme creates a warm, grounded, and sophisticated aesthetic—like a leather-bound journal or aged wood. It's professional yet approachable, serious yet warm. The amber and copper tones add richness without being overwhelming, while the neutral foundation keeps the focus on content.

## 🧭 Current Learning Focus

- **Linux Mastery**: System administration, bash scripting, internals
- **Python Scripting**: Automation, tooling, security workflows
- **C Fundamentals**: Memory management, pointers, system-level programming
- **Cloud Security**: Architecture patterns, IAM, preparing for Go

## 📝 Daily Logs Structure

Each log entry includes:
- **Date**: Formatted as "Month Day, Year"
- **Summary**: Brief overview of what was learned
- **Topics**: Number of areas covered
- **Hours**: Time invested
- **Tags**: Relevant technologies/concepts
